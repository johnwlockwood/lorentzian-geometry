## Velocity Slider

**What it does**: Lets you set a speed as a fraction of light‑speed (β = v/c). Dragging it instantly updates every other graphic.

**Why it matters**: In special relativity, all time‑dilation effects hinge on velocity. This slider is your master dial for exploring those effects.

## Gamma Readout

**What it does**: Shows the Lorentz factor γ, computed from the slider’s speed. Think of γ as the "stretch factor" for time and space.

**Why it matters**: Clocks run slower by a factor of γ and lengths contract by 1/γ. Seeing γ change numerically grounds the visuals in math.

## Minkowski Diagram

**What it does**: Plots spacetime (vertical = ct, horizontal = x). The orange world‑line tilts with speed, while the 45° light‑cone stays fixed.

**Why it matters**: This diagram reveals causality. As the world‑line tilts closer to the cone, proper time along it shrinks—visualizing time dilation geometrically.

## Gamma Graph

**What it does**: Charts γ versus β as a curve. A moving marker tracks the slider’s position.

**Why it matters**: The steep rise shows why even modest fractions of c barely dilate time, while near‑light speeds make γ—and relativity effects—skyrocket.

## Clock Animation

**What it does**: Two clocks tick side‑by‑side. The left clock measures coordinate time ("stationary observer"), the right clock measures proper time aboard the moving spaceship.

**Why it matters**: Watching the right clock slow visibly conveys time dilation without equations. It’s the Twin Paradox in miniature.
